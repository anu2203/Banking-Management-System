# Banking-Management-System

The Banking System Application is a user-friendly program designed to manage essential banking operations through a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using the Windows API in C. This application allows users to perform various tasks such as creating new bank accounts by entering an account number, name, and password, with all account information securely stored in a file called `accounts.dat`. Users can also view a list of all existing accounts, displaying details like account numbers, names, and current balances. The application supports financial transactions, enabling users to deposit or withdraw money from their accounts, with each transaction updating the account balance and logging the activity. Additionally, users can check their current account balance, update their account passwords for enhanced security, and view a comprehensive history of their transactions, including the date, type, and amount of each transaction. The application also provides the functionality to delete accounts, ensuring users have full control over their banking data. The system is designed to validate account numbers and passwords to prevent unauthorized access and includes error handling to notify users of invalid operations, such as incorrect password entries or insufficient funds for withdrawals. Overall, this application serves as an educational tool, demonstrating file handling, GUI development, and basic banking logic in C.
